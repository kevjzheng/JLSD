# JLSD - Julia SerDes
This repository hosts Pluto notebooks and relevant source codes for a personal project - using Julia to build fast and lightweight SerDes models and simulation framework

In the Pluto Notebooks directory, you will find the .jl files for the notebooks to be viewed and played with on your local machine. .html and .pdf files are also included in the directory

The goals for this project (still as its infant stage) are
- Document and share my personal Julia journey so far
- Using SerDes simulation as an example to demonstrate the pros/cons of Julia
- Begin a open-source and expandable SerDes simulation framework that encourages academia and industry adoption to evaluate more sophositicated architectures and algorithms
- Expose my fellow analog/mixed-signal designers to Julia (because not everyone can get a MATLAB license). It's much easier to design circuts when one can play with the specifications instead of taking it from others at face value
