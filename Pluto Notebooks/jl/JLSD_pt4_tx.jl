Let's build some meaningful models! We will use a transmitter as an example to show some important concepts in this simulation framework and Julia. 

To set the stage better, this notebook will have codes both in a cell (which you can run), and shown as just text. We have included/imported relevant source files into the notebook. The text block is just showing what the source code is to avoid variable definition collision, like below. The actual ```Drv``` struct is instantiated from the ```TrxStruct```  module.

With views, we can declare only one memory space for ```Vo_conv```, and create convience variables to make the first ```blk_size_osr``` length vector the actual output vector, and the rest becomes the memory vector that overalps with the beginning of the next block. The length for ```Vo_conv``` is known beforehand given the length of the ```ir``` vector and ```blk_size_osr```. 

This way, there is no need to explicitly copy and define ```Vo = Vo_conv[1:blk_size_osr]``` during our simulation to save space and time (something that's not possible in MATLAB). We will revisit this again when writing the convolution function later.

These parameters/variables are used for modeling TX jitter. Currently the model supports duty cycle distortion (```dcd```), normally distributed random jitter (```rj```) and sinuosoidal jitter (```sj```). The parameters are defined in their "most comfortable" units.

```prev_nui``` denotes the number of previous symbols to be stitched to the current block's signal to prevent overflow/underflow when jitter is introduced. ``` Δtt*``` vectors store the jitter information at each edge location. The ```tt_Vext``` vector is the jittered time grid vector. ```tt_uniform``` is the convience vector to remap the jittered waveform back to our simulation grid. ```Vext``` and ```V_prev_nui``` are the extended block vectors and the previous N-UI symbols.

A quick recap: the ```!``` is a Julian *convention* that denotes the function will mutate one or more of the arguments (usually the first argument).

That wasn't too bad, was it? Actually, we can directly use the ```u_conv!``` function for applying the FIR filter as well.

Jokes aside, modeling time domain phenomenon is always a challenge. How do we model jitter when our simulation time step is "fixed"? The key insight is that in our simulation framework, the zero crossing in the oversampled waveform is implicitly between the finite steps, i.e. @ t = N*osr+0.5. Despite our simulation time step being discrete, we can still use interpolation to "encode" where our zero crossing should be. Note that by using intermediate voltages, we can embed jitter information at fractional time steps.

## Conclusions

md"""
In this notebook, we covered the important concepts in a transmitter of model, including de-emphasis FIR, impulse responses, and jitter. A lot more is yet to be done, like nonlinearity and quantization.

The key modeling methods also directly apply to other circuit modules as well. Take advantage of views in Julia for more efficient use of memory. Convolution is a common function that will be shared among pretty much all blocks. Interpolation is important for transforming time axis as well as sampling (on the RX side). 

Though not directly related to the simulation framework itself, plots are important tools when it comes to visualization and debug. We will cover more in depth about the plotting packages in Julia in the next one so that you can start generating great plots too!
